 # Introduction to Postman course notes

 ## Unit 1 - Introduction to Postman

 ### Lesson 1 - Welcome


 ### Lesson 2 - Welcome

 ### Lesson 4 - Your first request with Postman

 #### ðŸ“š - Main ideas

 - to use an API you need to read the API documentation
 - work is Postman is organized in Workspaces
 - a status code 200 (or any status like 2XX) indicates that the request was successful

### Lesson 5 - HTTP

#### ðŸ“š - Main ideas

- the API we are using use the HTTPS protocol
- HTTPS stands for Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol
- HTTPS ensures that the connection is encrypted
- all APIs should use HTTPS
- from our point of view HTTP and HTTPS are the same
- the HTTP request message will contain: 
* URL (address)
* Request method (GET, POST, PUT, ...)
* Headers (User-Agent: Postman)
* Body
- the HTTP response message will contain: 
* Status code (200, 404, 500, ...)
* Headers
* Body

### Lesson 6 - Postman collections and variables

#### ðŸ“š - Main ideas
- you can save requests so that you can re-use them later on
- all requests need to be added to a Postman collection
- typically you will have a Postman collection for each API
- we are storing the base address of the API in a collection variable called `baseUrl`
- variables allow us to avoid repeating the same information
- variables allow us to easily make changes
- a Postman variable has two states
* INITIAL VALUE - this will be available to others if you share the collection
* CURRENT VALUE - this is private to you and this is the value that Postman uses


### Lesson 7 - Query parameters

#### ðŸ“š - Main ideas
- JSON is the most popular format that APIs use to send data
- query parameters start after the `?` in the URL
- the format is `key=value`
- muliple query parameters are delimited in the URL with an `&`. Example: `foo=1&bar=2`
- depending on the API, some query paramters can be optional or mandatory
- a response status 400 indicates an issue with the request data
- you can enable and disable parameters by clicking the checkbox associated with each key-value pair

### Lesson 8 - Assignment
- study the API documentation and use the `limit` query parameter in the `/books` endpoint
- try out different values
- can you make the API return a status code 400?


### Lesson 9 - Path variables

#### ðŸ“š - Main ideas
- `:bookId` is a path variable in the URL
- this endpoint allows us to specify a value that changes all the time, depending on the book
- `:bookId` is just a placeholder and does not get sent
- you can use path variables in combination with query parameters (if the API accepts this)


### Lesson 10 - POST request / API Authentication

#### ðŸ“š - Main ideas
- a `POST` request allows you to send data in the request body
- the endpoint for submitting orders requires authentication
- some APIs/endpoints are public and require no authentication
- other APIs/endpoints are private are require authentication
- an access token is temporary password generated by the API
- to send JSON, select the POST request method and from the Body select `Raw` and from the list `JSON`

### Lesson 11 - JSON format

#### ðŸ“š - Main ideas
- you need to specify valid JSON, otherwise the server won't understand your request
- use double-quotes for strings, separate key-value pairs with a comma sign `,`
- numbers, booleans don't need to be between quotes
- Postman will indicate when your JSON is invalid
